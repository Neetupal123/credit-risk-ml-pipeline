Executive Summary\n","\n","Financial institutions must accurately assess loan applicants to minimize financial losses caused by defaults. FinTech Solutions Inc. currently relies on a manual credit evaluation system that takes 3–5 days per application and produces inconsistent decisions.\n","\n","This project develops an automated Machine Learning pipeline to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan. Multiple classification models were developed and compared, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.\n","\n","The primary business objective was to achieve Recall ≥ 0.75, ensuring that most high-risk customers are correctly identified.\n","\n","After hyperparameter tuning using 5-fold cross-validation, XGBoost was selected as the final model. The solution includes MLflow tracking, model versioning, and a complete deployment strategy.\n","\n","The system is scalable, production-ready, and aligned with business requirements.\n","\n","## 2. Business Context\n","\n","FinTech Solutions Inc. is a digital lending company that provides personal loans to customers. The company faces the following challenges:\n","\n","* Manual credit assessment process\n","\n","* Decision delays (3–5 days per application)\n","\n","* Inconsistent risk evaluation\n","\n","* Financial losses due to undetected defaulters\n","\n","An automated ML-based system can significantly improve efficiency, consistency, and risk management.\n","\n","## 3. Problem Statement\n","\n","The objective is to build a classification model that predicts whether a loan applicant will:\n","\n","* Good Credit (Non-default)\n","\n","* Bad Credit (Default)\n","\n","The key business requirement is:\n","\n","* Maintain Recall ≥ 0.75 for detecting defaulters.\n","\n","## 4. Dataset Description\n","\n","The dataset contains customer financial and demographic information including:\n","\n","* Age\n","\n","- Sex\n","\n","- Job\n","\n","- Housing\n","\n","- Saving Accounts\n","\n","- Checking Account\n","\n","- Credit Amount\n","\n","- Duration\n","\n","- Purpose\n","\n","The target variable indicates whether the customer defaulted or not.\n","\n","## 5.
